## ðŸ“˜ About This Repository

This repo is designed for:
- Beginners struggling to understand recursion
- Those who feel stuck when writing base cases or recurrence
- Anyone preparing for coding interviews (especially for Dynamic Programming)

We believe recursion becomes easier when you:
1. Know what kind of problems need recursion
2. Follow a **fixed mental template (CRR)**
3. Practice with **illustrated breakdowns**

---

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside

- âœ… A document explaining the **CRR Template**
- âœ… A sample problem broken into CRR steps
- âœ… Notes on how to identify recursive structure
- ðŸš€ More examples coming soon!

## ðŸ§© CRR Template Overview

- **Choices**: What are the options at each step?
- **Result**: What result do you get after taking each choice?
- **Return**: What do you return from the current call?

Using this format consistently helps you break down even the trickiest recursion problems.

1. Open the [CRR_Template.pdf](./Recursion with CRR.docx) in this repo.
2. Read through the concept and example carefully.
3. Try writing the solution yourself after seeing the breakdown.
4. Practice with similar problems â€” and apply the CRR thinking each time.
